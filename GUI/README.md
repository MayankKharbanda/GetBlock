# GUI

> We have created a process-timeline to be presented as a GUI to the
user detailing how the process progresses through time.

## How to make it work?

#### What you need
+ nodejs (latest stable)
+ npm
+ a browser

#### How to run?

1. First open a terminal in the GUI directory
2. Now you need to install the npm modules necessary for correct operation.

```
npm install
```

3. Now you need to run the *server.js* file using node (here *node* refers
to *nodejs*, if you have *nodejs* installed instead of node you can create some
symbolic link or just replace *node* in following command with *nodejs*)

```
node server.js
```

4. Now open a browser and go to the link `localhost:3000`
